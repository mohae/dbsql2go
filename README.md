A package for generating Go code for DB tables.

__Work In Progress__

The API will change as support for additional RDBMSs are added. At this point, using this package directly is not recommended.

## CLI
Use the [dbsql2go](https://github.com/mohae/dbsql2go/cmd/dbsql2go) CLI to generate Go code from a database.

## Supported RDBMSs

MySQL is currently the only supported RDBMS.
